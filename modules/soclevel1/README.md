# Junior Security Analyst Intro
In the JSA role, you will be a Triage specialist, triaging or monitoring the event logs and alerts.

Desired certification is: the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)

Below is an overview of the SOC three-tier model:

https://www.trellix.com/security-awareness/operations/what-is-soc/ states their definition of a SOC: "Security operations teams are charged with monitoring and protecting many assets. These include intellectual property, personnel data, business systems, and brand integrity"

Below is an overview of the responsibilities of the SOC:

Prevention methods against attacks include  gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their [TTPs](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence) (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). Also includes maintenance procedures like updating the firewall signatures and more.

A SOC team uses [SIEM](https://www.fireeye.com/products/helix/what-is-siem-and-how-does-it-work.html) (Security information and event management) and [EDR](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response.html) (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities.

Imagine being a firefighter and having a multi-alarm fire - one-alarm fires, two-alarm fires, three-alarm fires; the categories classify the seriousness of the fire, which is a threat in our case. As a Security Analyst, you will learn how to prioritise the alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

# Pyramid Of Pain
This well-renowned concept is being applied to cybersecurity solutions like Cisco Security, SentinelOne, and SOCRadar to improve the effectiveness of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence), threat hunting, and incident response exercises.
