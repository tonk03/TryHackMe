# Search Skills:
Snake Oil is also a term in cybersec

ss (socket statistics) is replacing netstat in Linux

For google:
Use "exact phrase" to search for exact phrase
Use site: to search for results in specific site i.e. site:reddit.com cybersec
Use -, the minus sign to omit search results containing a particular word/phrase
Use filetype: to find for files instead of pages, such as PDF, DOC, XLS and PPT i.e. filetype:pdf [your favourite book]

Specialized search engines:
https://www.shodan.io/, a search engine for devices connected to the internet

https://search.censys.io/ appears similar to Shodan. However, Shodan focuses on Internet-connected devices and systems, such as servers, routers, webcams, and IoT devices. Censys, on the other hand, focuses on Internet-connected hosts. websites, certificates, and other Internet assets.

https://www.virustotal.com/c is an online website that provides a virus-scanning service for files using multiple antivirus engines.

https://haveibeenpwned.com/ (HIBP) does one thing; it tells you if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach.
